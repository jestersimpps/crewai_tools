# CrewAI Custom Tools Library

This repository contains a collection of custom tools developed for use with CrewAI. These tools extend the functionality of CrewAI and allow you to perform specialized tasks or integrate with external services.

## What is a CrewAI Tool?

A CrewAI tool is a reusable component that can be invoked by an AI agent to perform a specific task or operation. Tools can be used to interact with external systems, APIs, databases, or perform complex computations. They provide a way to extend the capabilities of the AI agent beyond its built-in knowledge and skills.

For more information about CrewAI tools, please refer to the official documentation: [CrewAI Tools](https://docs.crewai.com/core-concepts/Tools/)

## Getting Started

To use the tools in this repository, you'll need to have CrewAI installed and configured. Follow the instructions in the [CrewAI documentation](https://docs.crewai.com/getting-started/) to set up your environment.

Once you have CrewAI set up, you can use the tools in this repository and import them into your CrewAI project.

## Testing

The tools in this repository are designed to be compatible with smaller, locally-running language models, such as the 7-11B models. We test and validate the tools using these models to ensure they work as expected in local environments.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions to this library! If you have developed a custom tool that you think would be useful for others, please feel free to submit a pull request. Make sure to follow the coding guidelines and include documentation for your tool.
